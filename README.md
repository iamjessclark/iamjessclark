- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr Jessica Clark @ the University of Glasgow
- 👀 I’m interested in Neglected Tropical, and Zoonotic diseases. 
- 🌱 I use mostly mathematical and statistical modelling to 1) investigate how to improve, and the long term impact of treatment programmes, and 2) the factors that maintain persistent and cryptic transmission. I currently work on schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and Rift Valley Fever virus, and collect/ use data from across Uganda and Tanzania.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects working on other systems/ diseases, OneHealth projects and am happy to chat about any ideas you have that you think I might like too!
- 📫 How to reach me jessica dot clark at glasgow.ac.uk or @iamjessclark on twitter
