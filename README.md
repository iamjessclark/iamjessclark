- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr Jessica Clark @ the University of Glasgow
- 👀 I’m interested in Neglected Tropical Diseases (schisto, oncho) and how to improve interventions. 
- 🌱 I use mostly mathematical and statistical modelling to do this. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects working on other systems/ diseases, OneHealth projects and am happy to chat about any ideas you have that you think I might like too!
- 📫 How to reach me jessica dot clark at glasgow.ac.uk or @iamjessclark on twitter
